# Microprocessor Lab Exercises README

## Overview
This repository contains three laboratory exercises focused on microprocessors, emphasizing Monte Carlo simulations, logical circuit simulation for dynamic power consumption analysis, and signal probability calculation in logical circuits.

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Monte Carlo Simulations
- Implements functions to calculate Ï€ and switching activities in logic gates using Monte Carlo methods.
- Requires execution with specific inputs, code documentation, and graphical results representation.
- Preferred languages: Octave

### Lab 2: Logical Circuit Simulation
- Extends Lab 1's work to simulate logical circuits, assess dynamic power consumption, and calculate switching activities.
- Introduces NOT gate simulation and requires code files, graphical data representations.

### Lab 3: Signal Probability Calculation
- Develops a simulation model for calculating signal probabilities in logical circuits, requiring model implementation, input detection methods, and "testbench" routine verification.
- Emphasizes accuracy verification against previous exercises.

### Lab 4: Verilog and Modelsim Simulation
- Focuses on the design and simulation of a MicroCPU (MCPU) using Verilog.
- Exercise 4.1: Replicate and modify an example module, create a new testbench.
- Exercise 4.2: Familiarize with MCPU's ALU, modify a testbench.
- Exercise 4.3: Create a testbench for memory operations.
- Exercise 4.4: Expand MCPU to support 16 registers, incorporate student's ID into simulation waveforms.
  
### Lab 5: Enhancing MCPU Functionality
- **Exercise 5.1: Adding New Instructions**
  - Introduces Logical Shift Left (LSL) and Logical Shift Right (LSR) instructions.
- **Exercise 5.2: Implementing a Program**
  - Implements a program to calculate the Hailstone sequence, demonstrating the use of new instructions and bitwise logic operations.
 
    
Each lab builds on the knowledge and skills developed in the previous exercises, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of microprocessors, Verilog programming, and simulation techniques.
