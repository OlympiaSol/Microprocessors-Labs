# Microprocessors Lab Exercises README

## Overview
This repository hosts three lab exercises focusing on microprocessors, specifically tailored for understanding dynamic power consumption and switching activity through practical implementation.

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Monte Carlo Simulation for π Calculation and Switching Activity
- Implement a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate π using a square and an inscribed circle.
- Develop a program to compute the switching activity of a four-input OR gate using Monte Carlo simulation.

### Lab 2: Signal Probabilities Calculation
- Complete and implement functions for calculating signal probabilities for 2-input logic gates.
- Develop functions from scratch for 3-input and N-input logic gates signal probabilities and switching activity.

### Lab 3: Implementation in Octave, C, or C++
- Opt to use Octave for implementing the given tasks.
- Focus on editing preferences in Octave for correct display of Greek characters in comments
