# Microprocessor Lab Exercises README

## Overview
This repository contains three laboratory exercises focused on microprocessors, emphasizing Monte Carlo simulations, logical circuit simulation for dynamic power consumption analysis, and signal probability calculation in logical circuits.

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Monte Carlo Simulations
- Implements functions to calculate Ï€ and switching activities in logic gates using Monte Carlo methods.
- Requires execution with specific inputs, code documentation, and graphical results representation.
- Preferred languages: Octave

### Lab 2: Logical Circuit Simulation
- Extends Lab 1's work to simulate logical circuits, assess dynamic power consumption, and calculate switching activities.
- Introduces NOT gate simulation and requires code files, graphical data representations.

### Lab 3: Signal Probability Calculation
- Develops a simulation model for calculating signal probabilities in logical circuits, requiring model implementation, input detection methods, and "testbench" routine verification.
- Emphasizes accuracy verification against previous exercises.
